This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error. The program attempts to iterate through an array, but the loop condition is incorrect, leading to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate through an array and avoid this error.
